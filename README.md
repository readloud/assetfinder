## Install

If you have Go installed and configured (i.e. with `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`):

```
go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
```

Otherwise [download a release for your platform](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder/releases).
To make it easier to execute you can put the binary in your `$PATH`.
